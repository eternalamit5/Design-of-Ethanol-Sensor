# Design-of-Ethanol-Sensor

The aim of the project was to design an ethanol capacitive sensor, use different mediums (varying
proportions of water & ethanol) and characterize the device using dielectric properties of the
media.

This following report discusses about the fabrication of Ethanol Sensor, which are used in
environmental and industrial monitoring. Following were the steps to design, fabricate and
test a micro fluidic sensor.
1. Layout design using COMSOL MULTIPHYSICS 5.2
2. Varying parameters and simulating the results for the best design using COMSOL.
3. Development of mask and sensor housings using INVENTOR.
4. Fabrication of Sensor in clean room.
5. Measurement results and performance analysis.
6. Sensor Characterization.
